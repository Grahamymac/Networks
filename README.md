# Networks Group Exercise

The purpose of this exercise is for you to get to know some of your classmates,
learn more about networks in a group environment, and see how github can be used to
collaborate.

When you get into class, you will pull a number out of a bag to determine your group.

*Group 1 has 6 students, and the remaining 5 groups will have 5 students.*

Group 1 will discuss the first video, *Wires Cables and WIFI*.

Group 2 will discuss the second video, *IP Addresses and DNS*.

Group 3 will do *Packets, Routers, and Reliability*.

Group 4 will review *HTTP and HTML*.

Group 5 will go over *Encryption and Keys*.

Group 6 will discuss *Cybersecurity and Crime*.

Each person will decide on a fact or topic that they find interesting and write a
very brief one- or two-liner definition, description or thought. If more
than two students are interested in the same topic, just come up with an different
angle.

Your card will have a number on it that will correspond to one of the files below. You will make your edits to my repository using the file that corresponds with your number.
I created these files on my mac via the terminal, but you will make changes via the github web interface. This is very easy; I will show you how to do this in class today.

When you try to edit a file, you will be prompted to "fork" the file or repository. Do that, then you will be prompted to propose changes. Make your changes and then create a pull request. Github will then try to check to see if there are merge conflicts. (There should not be any, unless someone else accidentally tries to update your file.) Keep going until you click through all the steps. I will get your pull request, then I will confirm the changes and then merge them into the repository.
