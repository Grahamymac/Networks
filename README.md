# Networks Group Exercise

The purpose of this exercise is for you to get to know some of your classmates,
learn more about networks in a group environment, and see how github can be used to
collaborate.

When you get into class, you will pull a number out of a bag to determine your group.

*Group 1 has 6 students, and the remaining 5 groups will have 5 students.*

Group 1 will discuss the first video, wires cables and wifi.

Group 2 will discuss the second video, ip addresses and dns.

Group 3 will do packets, routers, and reliability.

Group 4 will review http and html.

Group 5 will go over encryption and keys.

Group 6 will discuss cybersecurity and crime.

Each person will decide on a fact or topic that they find interesting and write a
very brief one- or two-liner definition, description or thought. If more
than two students are interested in the same topic, just come up with an different
angle.

Your card will have a number on it that will correspond to one of the files below. You will make your edits to my repository using the file that corresponds with your number.
I created these files on my mac via the terminal, but you will make changes via the github web interface. This is very easy; I will show you how to do this in class today.

When you try to edit a file, you will be prompted to "fork" the file or repository. Do that then you will be prompted to propose changes. Make your changes and then create a pull request. It will then check to see if there are merge conflicts. (There should not be any, unless someone else accidentally tries to update your file.) I will will get your pull request, and I will will merge them into the repository.
