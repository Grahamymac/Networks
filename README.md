# Networks Group Exercise

The purpose of this exercise is for you to get to know some of your classmates,
learn more about networks in a group environment, and see how github can be used to
collaborate.

When you get into class, you will pull a number out of a bag to determine your group.

*Group 1 has 6 students, and the remaining 5 groups will have 5 students.*

Group 1 will discuss the first video, wires cables and wifi.

Group 2 will discuss the second video, ip addresses and dns.

Group 3 will do packets, routers, and reliability.

Group 4 will review http and html.

Group 5 will go over encryption and keys.

Group 6 will discuss cybersecurity and crime.

Each person will decide on a fact or topic that they find interesting and write a
very brief one- or two-liner definition, description or thought. If more
than two students are interested in the same topic, just come up with an different
angle

There are 6 markdown files in this github repository. Each five has spots for you to
put in your text. I will show you how to make changes.



 Decide what number you will
be in your group.
